# Resta 1 - React (Peg Solitaire)

This is a project I created to practice my recently acquired React/Redux skills.

It's goal was to see if I could develop a Peg Solitaire game using the React/Redux architecture without any help. :-)

Peg Solitaire was the first game I wrote in early 1980's, when I was a kid. It was originally written in BASIC, on a TRS-80 Color 8 bits home computer.
Since then I often write it again in different technologies/languages, just for fun.

Unfortunately it is not working on mobile devices yet, due to the drag & drop feature.
Please bear in mind I am a backend developer. ;-)

Any comments and feedback are welcome.

Thanks for your interest on this!
